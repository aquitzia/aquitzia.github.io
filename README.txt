I'm a machine learning engineer. Please check out my ML models and ML ops architecture design in my other repos.

This repo is the code for my GitHub Pages website. I altered a design from HTML5 UP (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) as a quick way to display my recent work with ML models. I'll be adding my own code soon.
